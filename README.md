# TowerOpedia

> This app is to view, add or delete data for building owners. In this app, the clients are the building owners so the user has option to select their respective username to view the data for them. The application is a MERN stack app . It follows the CRUD convention. As per the requirements the app doesnot contain the ability to create or edit clients, although to add it working I had to create a seperate route for that, this can be tested on the server via Postman or browser. The application enhances the CRUD operations to it's child Schema "Buildings" which is directly owned by the parent client profile. Whole project is based on the MaterialUI library, the project also has it's custom theme to make use of the MaterialUI dark mode option.

## Usage:

- To see the application select a client from the list below.
- Application shows Two components, `BuildingList` and `BuildingsMap`, to view a building on the map click the building to `FlyTo` the location of the building.
- To `Edit` a building click on edit against the respective building to open the form and populate the data with the building data.
- To `Delete` a building click on the delete icon against the respective building to open the form and populate the data with the building data.
- To `Add` a building click on the Add button at the end of the form to open the form with empty values to add to the Building list.
- After `Add`/`Edit` the map renders to show the respective building on the map.

## To improve

If a user is editing a building data and wants to edit another building, a same instance should call to check if the user data is not equal to the prevState data that was passed on the form. In that case the map should not appear and the form should populate the new building values to edit.

![Edit Form](./Editfrom.gif)

There can be a user preference setting system. So that on default the application would stay on the preffered mode `Light` or `Dark` to view the content, however if the user has not selected a mode explicity on the application the default mode can be the `system` setting of the user. This will prevent the application to go into a set default mode on refresh or load, in this case `Light` mode, providing more natural and better experience.
